    abstract = "{Inference is considered for the point in a sequence of random variables at which the probability distribution changes. An approximation to the conditional distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator of the changepoint given the ancillary values of observations adjacent to the estimated changepoint is derived and shown to be numerically equal to a Bayesian posterior distribution for the changepoint. A hydrological example is given to show that inferences based on the conditional distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator can differ sharply from inferences based on the marginal distribution}",
