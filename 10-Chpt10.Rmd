# Environmental hazards-spatial models {#hazards}

This chapter contains the basic theory for spatial processes and a number of approaches to modelling point-referenced spatial data. From this chapter, the reader will have gained an understanding of the following topics:

- Visualization techniques needed for both exploring and analyzing spatial data and communicating its features through the use of maps.
- Exploring the underlying structure of spatial data and methods for characterizing dependence over space.
- Second-order theory for spatial processes including the covariance. The variogram for measuring spatial associations.
- Stationarity and isotropy.
- Methods for spatial prediction, using both classical methods (kriging) as well as modern methods (Bayesian kriging).
- Non-stationarity fields.
