Welcome! 

This is a repository that contains the code for the examples in Spatio-Temporal Methods in Environmental Epidemiology by Gavin Shaddick, James V. Zidek, Alexandra M. Schmidt. 

The html file was based on R Markdown and **bookdown** (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown). 

## Prerequisites

The packages necessary for each of the examples are loaded at the beginning of each example. But, we recommend installing Stan (http://mc-stan.org/rstan/) and NIMBLE (https://r-nimble.org/) 

## What's in here?

- *functions:* contains the stan code for the Stan examples and they are named after the example number.
- *data:* contains the necessary datasets for the examples and some selected exercises. 

## How to run it

You just have to download or copy/paste the code for each of the examples.

## More information


The R version used to write this code is 4.2.2
