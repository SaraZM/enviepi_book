"],["preface-2nd-edition.html", "Preface (2nd edition)", " Preface (2nd edition) Spatio-Temporal Methods in Environmental Epidemiology is the first book of its kind to specifically address the interface between environmental epidemiology and spatio-temporal modeling. In response to the growing need for collaboration between statisticians and environmental epidemiologists, the book links recent developments in spatio-temporal methodology with epidemiological applications. Drawing on real-life problems, it provides the tools required to exploit advances in methodology when assessing the health risks associated with environmental hazards. Clear guidelines are given to enable the implementation of methodology and estimation of risks in practice. Designed for graduate students in both epidemiology and statistics, the text covers a wide range of topics, from an introduction to epidemiological principles and the foundations of spatio-temporal modeling to new directions for research. It describes traditional and Bayesian approaches and presents the theory of spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal modeling in the context of its application to environmental epidemiology. The text includes practical examples together with embedded R code and details of specific R packages and the use of other software including Nimble, Stan, and INLA. Online resources associated with the book provide additional code, data, examples, exercises, lab projects, and more. Representing a major new direction in environmental epidemiology, this book—in full color throughout—underscores the increasing need to consider dependencies in both space and time when modeling epidemiological data. Students will learn how to identify and model patterns in spatio-temporal data and to exploit dependencies over both space and time in order to reduce bias and inefficiency. From this book the reader will have gained an understanding of the following topics: The basic concepts of epidemiology and the estimation of risks associated with environmental hazards. Hierarchical modelling with a Bayesian framework. The theory of spatial, temporal and spatio–temporal process needed for environmental health risk analysis. Fundamental questions related to the nature and role of uncertainty in environmental epidemiology and methods which may help answer those questions. Important areas of application within environmental epidemiology together with strategies for building the models that are needed and coping with challenges that arise. Methods and software for the analysis and visualisation of environmental and health. - Examples of R and WinBUGS code are given throughout the book and, together with data for the examples the code, are included in the online resources. Offer a variety of exercises, both theoretical and practical, to assist in the development of the skills needed to perform spatio–temporal analyses. New frontiers and areas of current and future research. "],["why.html", "Chapter 1 Why spatio-temporal epidemiology?", " Chapter 1 Why spatio-temporal epidemiology?

From this chapter, the reader will have gained an understanding of the following topics: Methods for expressing risk and their use with different types of epidemiological study. Calculating risks based on calculations of the expected number of health counts in an area, allowing for the age–sex structure of the underlying population. The use of generalised linear models (GLMS) to model counts of disease and case–control indicators. Modelling the effect of exposures on health and allowing for the possible effects of covariates. Cumulative exposures to environmental hazards. "],["uncertainty.html", "Chapter 3 Uncertainty and its reduction", " Chapter 3 Uncertainty and its reduction This chapter contains a discussion of uncertainty, both in terms of statistical modelling and quantification but also in the wider setting of sources of uncertainty outside those normally encountered in statistics. From this chapter, the reader will have gained an understanding of the following topics: Uncertainty can be dichotomised as either qualitative or quantitative, with the former allowing consideration of a wide variety of sources of uncertainty that would be difficult, if not impossible, to quantify mathematically. Quantitative uncertainty can be thought of as comprising both aleatory and epistemic components, the former representing stochastic uncertainty and the latter subjective uncertainty. Methods for assessing uncertainty including eliciting prior information from experts and sensitivity analysis. Indexing quantitative uncertainty using the variance and entropy of the distribution of a random quantity. Uncertainty in post-normal science derives from a wide variety of issues and can lead to high levels of that uncertainty with serious consequences. Understanding uncertainty is therefore a vital feature of modern environmental epidemiology.

From this chapter, the reader will have gained an understanding of the following topics: The use of prior distributions to capture beliefs before data are observed. The combination of prior beliefs and information from data to obtain posterior beliefs. The manipulation of prior distributions with likelihoods to formulate posterior distributions and why conjugate priors are useful in this regard. The difference between informative and non-informative priors. The use of the posterior distribution for inference and methods for calculating summary measures. "],["tactics.html", "Chapter 6 Tactics-implementing uncertainty models Example 6.2: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in England Example 6.3: Fitting a Poisson regression model in Nimble", " Chapter 6 Tactics-implementing uncertainty models This chapter describes methods for implementing Bayesian models when their complexity means that simple, analytic solutions may not be available. From this chapter, the reader will have gained an understanding of the following topics: Analytical approximations to the posterior distribution. Using samples from a posterior distribution for inference and Monte Carlo integration. Methods for direct sampling such as importance and rejection sampling. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and methods for obtaining samples from the required posterior distribution including Metropolis–Hastings and Gibbs algorithms. Using nimble and stan to fit Bayesian models using Gibbs sampling. Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations (INLA) as a method for performing efficient Bayesian inference including the use of R–INLA to implement a wide variety of latent process models. Example 6.2: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in England We now look at example into the hospital admission rates for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in England between 2001–2010. In England, there are 324 local authority administrative areas each with an observed and expected number of cases. The expected numbers were calculated using indirect standardization by applying the age–sex specific rates for the whole of England to the age–sex population profile of each of the areas. For this example, the following packages are needed ggplot2 and sf. Load the necessary packages. library(ggplot2) library(sf) To create SMR maps, we need to read in the relevant shapefiles. englandlocalauthority.shp and englandlocalauthority.dbf contain the location, shape, and attributes of English local authorities. The function read_sf() from the sf package will read these shapefiles into R. copdmortalityobserved.csv contains the observed number of hospital admissions in England by local authority. copdmortalityexpected.csv contains the expected number of hospital admissions in England by local authority. # Reading in borders england &lt;- read_sf(&quot;data/englandlocalauthority.shp&quot;) # Reading in data observed &lt;- read.csv(file = &quot;data/copdmortalityobserved.csv&quot;, row.names = 1) expected &lt;- read.csv(file = &quot;data/copdmortalityexpected.csv&quot;, row.names = 1) Print summaries of the observed and expected counts. # Printing first six rows of the observed counts head(observed) ## name Y2001 Y2002 Y2003 Y2004 Y2005 Y2006 Y2007 Y2008 ## 00AA City of London LB 2 0 3 1 1 1 5 1 ## 00AB Barking and Dagenham LB 100 100 122 93 136 97 91 96 ## 00AC Barnet LB 110 102 106 89 99 97 72 84 ## 00AD Bexley LB 109 113 113 96 113 97 94 89 ## 00AE Brent LB 69 89 70 59 61 48 53 46 ## 00AF Bromley LB 120 129 135 124 128 117 120 106 ## Y2009 Y2010 ## 00AA 0 1 ## 00AB 101 78 ## 00AC 78 89 ## 00AD 93 93 ## 00AE 55 43 ## 00AF 107 113 # Printing first six rows of the expected counts head(expected) ## E2001 E2002 E2003 E2004 E2005 E2006 ## 00AA 2.648915 2.68106 2.727112 2.749562 2.808655 2.915977 ## 00AB 63.946730 63.41700 62.567863 61.444884 60.677119 59.678672 ## 00AC 121.795213 121.91534 122.451050 123.201898 124.449563 125.982868 ## 00AD 90.201336 91.24645 91.949050 92.754781 93.674540 94.598593 ## 00AE 76.876437 77.18529 78.017980 78.967493 80.422828 81.785325 ## 00AF 131.182934 132.30521 133.257442 134.520920 136.441229 137.382528 ## E2007 E2008 E2009 E2010 ## 00AA 3.021586 3.114696 3.237998 3.237998 ## 00AB 58.487583 57.701932 57.250524 57.250524 ## 00AC 127.088805 128.825149 131.374946 131.374946 ## 00AD 95.447131 96.832061 97.651369 97.651369 ## 00AE 83.651266 85.265264 87.089119 87.089119 ## 00AF 138.634021 139.508507 140.634084 140.634084 # Summarising the observed counts summary(observed) ## name Y2001 Y2002 Y2003 ## Length:324 Min. : 2.00 Min. : 0.00 Min. : 3.00 ## Class :character 1st Qu.: 35.00 1st Qu.: 38.00 1st Qu.: 38.00 ## Mode :character Median : 50.00 Median : 52.00 Median : 52.00 ## Mean : 68.01 Mean : 69.63 Mean : 73.44 ## 3rd Qu.: 83.50 3rd Qu.: 80.75 3rd Qu.: 83.25 ## Max. :445.00 Max. :438.00 Max. :480.00 ## Y2004 Y2005 Y2006 Y2007 ## Min. : 1.00 Min. : 1.00 Min. : 1.00 Min. : 5.00 ## 1st Qu.: 35.00 1st Qu.: 37.00 1st Qu.: 35.00 1st Qu.: 37.00 ## Median : 49.50 Median : 51.00 Median : 49.00 Median : 50.00 ## Mean : 66.67 Mean : 69.37 Mean : 67.07 Mean : 68.17 ## 3rd Qu.: 81.25 3rd Qu.: 80.50 3rd Qu.: 81.00 3rd Qu.: 79.00 ## Max. :428.00 Max. :395.00 Max. :428.00 Max. :456.00 ## Y2008 Y2009 Y2010 ## Min. : 1.00 Min. : 0.00 Min. : 1.00 ## 1st Qu.: 37.00 1st Qu.: 36.00 1st Qu.: 38.00 ## Median : 51.00 Median : 50.00 Median : 51.00 ## Mean : 71.40 Mean : 67.04 Mean : 68.81 ## 3rd Qu.: 84.25 3rd Qu.: 78.00 3rd Qu.: 81.25 ## Max. :463.00 Max. :394.00 Max. :441.00 # Summarising the expected counts summary(expected) ## E2001 E2002 E2003 E2004 ## Min. : 2.649 Min. : 2.681 Min. : 2.727 Min. : 2.75 ## 1st Qu.: 39.066 1st Qu.: 39.456 1st Qu.: 39.849 1st Qu.: 40.60 ## Median : 51.766 Median : 52.671 Median : 53.487 Median : 54.29 ## Mean : 62.944 Mean : 63.589 Mean : 64.139 Mean : 64.72 ## 3rd Qu.: 74.292 3rd Qu.: 74.974 3rd Qu.: 74.701 3rd Qu.: 74.02 ## Max. :370.913 Max. :371.271 Max. :369.861 Max. :368.87 ## E2005 E2006 E2007 E2008 ## Min. : 2.809 Min. : 2.916 Min. : 3.022 Min. : 3.115 ## 1st Qu.: 41.646 1st Qu.: 42.497 1st Qu.: 43.203 1st Qu.: 44.262 ## Median : 54.765 Median : 55.506 Median : 56.552 Median : 57.522 ## Mean : 65.440 Mean : 66.180 Mean : 67.022 Mean : 67.950 ## 3rd Qu.: 75.003 3rd Qu.: 75.260 3rd Qu.: 75.790 3rd Qu.: 76.935 ## Max. :368.565 Max. :367.838 Max. :368.026 Max. :368.291 ## E2009 E2010 ## Min. : 3.238 Min. : 3.238 ## 1st Qu.: 45.062 1st Qu.: 45.062 ## Median : 58.077 Median : 58.077 ## Mean : 68.901 Mean : 68.901 ## 3rd Qu.: 78.166 3rd Qu.: 78.166 ## Max. :368.940 Max. :368.940 Modelling the raw standardized mortality rates (SMRs) Calculate the raw SMRs as. \\[ \\text{SMR} = \\dfrac{observed}{expected}\\] SMR_raw &lt;- observed[, -1] / expected # Rename columns names(SMR_raw) &lt;- c( &quot;SMR2001&quot;, &quot;SMR2002&quot;, &quot;SMR2003&quot;, &quot;SMR2004&quot;, &quot;SMR2005&quot;, &quot;SMR2006&quot;, &quot;SMR2007&quot;, &quot;SMR2008&quot;, &quot;SMR2009&quot;, &quot;SMR2010&quot;

From this chapter, the reader will have gained an understanding of the following topics: Additional power that can be gained in an epidemiological study by combining the contrasts in the process over both time and space while characterizing the stochastic dependencies across both space and time for inferential analysis. Criteria that good approaches to spatio–temporal modelling should satisfy. General strategies for developing such approaches. Separability and non-separability in spatio–temporal models, and how these could be characterize using the Kronecker product of correlation matrices. Examples of the use of spatio–temporal models in modelling environmental exposures. "],["causality.html", "Chapter 13 Causality-roadblocks on the way to it", " Chapter 13 Causality-roadblocks on the way to it This chapter contains a discussion of the differences between causality and association. It also covers specific issues that may be encountered in this area when investigating the effects of environmental hazards on health. From this chapter, the reader will have gained an understanding of the following topics: Issues with causality in observational studies. The Bradford–Hill criteria which are a group of minimal conditions necessary to provide adequate evidence of a causal relationship. Ecological bias which may occur when inferences about the nature of individuals are made using aggregated data. The role of exposure variability in determining the extent of ecological bias. Approaches to acknowledging ecological bias in ecological studies. Concentration and exposure response functions. Models for estimating personal exposures including micro-environments. "],["monitoring.html", "Chapter 14 Better monitoring network design-getting better measurements", " Chapter 14 Better monitoring network design-getting better measurements This chapter looks at the emergence of a central purpose; to explore or reduce uncertainty about aspects of the environmental processes of interest. One form of uncertainty, aleatory, cannot be reduced by definition whereas with the other, epistemic, where uncertainty can be reduced (see Chapter 3). However that reduction does not stop the original network from becoming sub-optimal over time, pointing to the need to regularly reassess its performance. From that perspective we see that the design criteria must allow for the possibility of ‘gauging’ (adding monitors to) sites that Maximally reduce uncertainty at their space–time points (measuring their responses eliminates their uncertainty); Best minimise uncertainty at other locations; Best inform about process parameters; Best detect non-compliers. From this chapter, the reader will have gained an understanding of many of the challenges that the network designer may face. These involve the following topics: A multiplicity of valid design objectives. Unforeseen and changing objectives. A multiplicity of responses at each site, i.e. which should be monitored. A need to use prior knowledge and to characterise prior uncertainty. A need to formulate realistic process models. A requirement to take advantage of, and integrate with, existing networks. The need to be realistic, meaning to contend with economic as well as administrative demands and constraints.
